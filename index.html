                <h3>UBISOFT NEXT PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD - 'LIGHTLOCK'</h3>
                <p>A local multiplayer puzzle game. Players are trapped on an island and chained to each other.
                    They must work together to escape the island. Various obstacles and enemies lurk throughout.
                    I implemented the chain physics, ladder climbing system, and handled movement errors.

                <h3>C++ GAME - 'Job Hunt'</h3>
                <p>A C++ game using SDL2's window, text, and audio to create an interactive experience.
                    Players search for jobs and perform them to gain experience and money. They are able to continue
                    progressing by completing more difficult jobs. I was responsible for leading a small team of 3
                    and implementing the audio, text, buttons, and logic for the job mechanics.

                <h3>UNITY - 'AR Chess'</h3>
                <p>A Unity project using the built in Augmented Reality system to play chess. The chessboard
                    appears in front of you in real-time and you are able to pass and play along with tapping
                    the 'physical' piece on the screen. This was a solo project where I completed all the logic
                    and used free chess assets. </p>
